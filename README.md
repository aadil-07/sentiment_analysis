## Sentiment Analysis Using NLP and LSTM
Project Overview

This project classifies airline customer reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (LSTM). The model helps businesses understand customer sentiment and improve their services.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of customer reviews from the airline industry, with sentiment labels indicating whether the review is positive or negative.

Columns:

text: The customer review (string).

airline_sentiment: The sentiment of the review, either "positive" or "negative".

Source: Kaggle 

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Frameworks:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: Visualization of model performance.

tensorflow (Keras API): For building and training the deep learning model.

sklearn: Data splitting and preprocessing.

re: Text preprocessing (for cleaning data).

## Results

After training, the model produces the following evaluation metrics:

Validation Accuracy: 0.9567

Validation Loss: 0.1201

Sample output predictions:

"The flight was amazing!" → Positive
"Worst experience ever." → Negative

## Future Scope
Model Improvement:

Experiment with advanced models like BERT, GPT, or GRU to further improve accuracy.
Implement hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model's performance.

Deployment and Scalability:

Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time sentiment analysis using Flask, FastAPI, or a similar framework.
Host the model on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for scalable inference.


Expanded Applications:

Extend the sentiment analysis to handle multi-class sentiments (e.g., very positive, neutral, very negative).
Implement multilingual sentiment analysis for broader use cases.

Explainability and Visualization:

Use tools like SHAP or LIME to interpret the model’s predictions and improve trust in the results.
Develop a dashboard to visualize sentiment trends over time.

Performance Optimization:

Leverage GPU/TPU acceleration for faster training.
Optimize the database for storing and retrieving large-scale sentiment analysis results.
